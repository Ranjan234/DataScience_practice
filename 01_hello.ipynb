    "# * Why learn python *\n",
    " Python is a free, open-source programming \n",
    " language that is both powerful and easy to learn.\n",
    " It has become one of the most popular languages \n",
    "in the world due to its accessibility, flexibility, ease \n",
    "of use, and wide range of applications, including:\n",
    " • Data Analytics\n",
    " • Software Development\n",
    " • Machine Learning\n",

    "# WHY PYTHON FOR ANALYTICS?\n",
    "• Scalability: Unlike most analytics tools or self-service Business Intelligence platforms, Python is open source, free to use, and built for scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "• versatility: With powerful libraries and frameworks, Python can add value at every stage of the analytics workflow, from data prep and analysis to machine learning and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Community: Become part of a large and active Python user community, where you can share resources, get help, offer support, and connect with other users. \n",
    "\n",
    "• Automation: Python can automate complex tasks and workflows out of the box, without complicated integrations or custom plug-ins\n",
    "\n",
    "• Demand: Python skills are valuable and highly sought after, and are becoming increasingly popular among \n",
    "analytics and Business Intelligence professionals.\n",
